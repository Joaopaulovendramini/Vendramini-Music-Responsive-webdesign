# Vendramini-Music-Responsive-webdesign
 created a website that was inspired by Spotify, with responsive design that perfectly fits all screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop computers,
 and the best part: all of this was accomplished without the use of any frameworks.
 I developed this project using only HTML and CSS, focusing on learning how to use the @media only screen feature.
